I am a junior Front-end developer who is searching a job. I always want to be a better person as a professional developer and also as a co-worker.

So, as a one step of "Being a better version of me" journey, I started writing technical posts in this blog.

My programming skills will improve by writing every post. and also I hope all these posts help other developers like me who are looking for a guide.
